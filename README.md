# Canvas Signature Board

This is a web app built with React that lets users draw, caption, and save signatures or sketches on a large canvas. You can pan around, draw multiple strokes, add optional captions, and export the final work as a PNG. The app supports loading previously saved signatures and prevents drawing over existing ones.  

## What It Does

Itâ€™s basically a digital signature playground with some fancy features like multi-stroke drawing, outline detection, and real-time coordinate tracking. Not perfect, but it gets the job done.
